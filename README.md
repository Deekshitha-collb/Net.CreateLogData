**Description:**
- This project analyzes network activities using clustering and visualization techniques.
-  By organizing data into clusters, we can better understand user behavior, key actions, and trends within the network.
-  The project includes code to create visualizations and insights that help in optimizing network performance.

**Key Features:**
- Data Clustering: We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to group similar actions together. Each cluster represents a different type of activity within the network.
- User Activity Analysis: Visualizations show how different users interact with the system, including the sequence and frequency of their actions.
- Node Editing and Commenting: The project examines how users edit and comment on nodes, helping identify who the most active contributors are.
- Timeline of Node Interactions: This feature tracks how nodes are interacted with over time, including edits, comments, and other activities.
